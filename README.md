## WHAT I LEARNED üéì

Creating this website was a journey of discovery and skill development. Here are some of the key lessons I learned during this project:

- Design Focus: I placed significant emphasis on the design of the website, ensuring that colors and images harmonize to create an appealing visual experience. The aesthetic coherence was crucial to make a lasting impression on visitors.

- Grid and Flexbox: I extensively used Grid and Flexbox to structure the layout of the site. These powerful CSS tools allowed me to create a flexible and efficient design, ensuring that content is well-organized and visually appealing across all devices.

- Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures a consistent and optimal user experience, whether the site is accessed on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

Through this project, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also gained valuable insights into creating user-friendly and visually striking websites. Thank you for visiting Marketing Agency More and More.
